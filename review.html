    <h2>Graphics</h2>
    <p>GTA 5 still looks great almost 12 years after its release. From realistic lighting to detailed cityscapes, the games visual design brings Los Santos to life with incredible detail, further improved with the release of GTA 5 Enhanced Edition, which added ray tracing functionality.</p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>The open-world experience is unmatched. Whether you're robbing banks, racing cars, or just exploring, there's always something to do. The controls are smooth, and switching between characters adds depth to missions.</p>

    <h2>Storyline & Multiplayer</h2>
    <p>The story follows three unique criminals, Michael, Trevor, and Franklin, each with their own background and motivation. The missions are exciting and full of variety.</p>

    <h2>Sound</h2>
    <p>The game features top-tier voice acting, an incredible radio station lineup, and immersive ambient sound. Everything from explosions to traffic adds to the realism.</p>
